#   1. My Church Attendance Tracker (MyCAT)

##  2. Description
MyCAT is a church attendance tracking application that helps you manage and monitor attendance during Sunday services and other weekly programs.

## 3. Motivation
The idea for My Church Attendance Tracker was born out of a desire to contribute something tangible to my church community. As a christ follower and someone who love the things of God, and constantly looking for ways to advancing His kingdom here on earth (the church), I saw a need for a more efficient and easy way to manage attendance at our Sunday services and weekly programs.

Tracking attendance manually was often time-consuming and prone to errors, making it difficult to keep accurate records and engage with our congregation effectively. I wanted to create a tool that would simplify this process, for the usering department, or whoever is responsible for task of tracking the attendance. 

This project is a reflection of my commitment to my faith and my church community. I believe that by making it easier to track and understand our Sunday services and other weekly programs attendance patterns, commitment and growth. My hope is that this application will be a blessing to other churches as well, helping them to manage and monitor attendance during their church services.
